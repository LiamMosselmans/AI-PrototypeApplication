# AI-PrototypeApplication

UPLOAD NOTE
Due to the file size limit on Github, only the 3D models and textures are available in the repository.
To test the prototype, use the following google drive link to download the zip that holds the prototype: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/14W-XCNwdSRbiUO3DN_2QI-bgoXUdU6HJ?usp=sharing


IMPORTANT UNZIPPING NOTE
Due to the long path of the project folder, it can give issues when unzipping. Unzip the file on your desktop or any short path location like in downloads to be able to unzip it fully.
If the file were to be unzipped while in a deep path like this: "C:\Users\Liam\Desktop\School\Multech 2023-2024\Semester 2\Artificial Intelligence", then it will not complete the unzipping process and give an error instead.
